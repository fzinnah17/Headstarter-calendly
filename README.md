08/17/22 - Calendar components finished, react video call feature done, need to tie them together <br>
08/18/22 - Uriah finished backend functionalities at 1:45am, need to tie the calendar and video call into Uriah's app asap (most of the stuff on uriah's side is from a tutorial so we can cut out what we don't need and simply if need be)
